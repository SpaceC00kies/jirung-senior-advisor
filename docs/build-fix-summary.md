# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The `npm run build` command was failing with "Missing Supabase environment variables" error.

## Root Cause
The codebase uses Supabase for database operations, but the environment configuration files were set up for Vercel KV instead. The required Supabase environment variables were missing:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` 
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Fix Applied
1. **Updated `.env.example`**: Added proper Supabase configuration section with instructions
2. **Updated `.env.local`**: Added placeholder Supabase credentials that allow the build to complete
3. **Marked legacy database options**: Commented out unused Vercel KV and Postgres configurations

## Next Steps for Production
To use this application in production, you need to:

1. **Create a Supabase project** at https://supabase.com/
2. **Set up the database schema** with the required tables:
   - `question_logs` 
   - `user_feedback`
3. **Get your credentials** from Supabase project settings > API:
   - Project URL
   - Anon/public key  
   - Service role key (keep this secret!)
4. **Update `.env.local`** with your actual Supabase credentials
5. **For deployment**, set these environment variables in your hosting platform (Vercel, etc.)

## Current Status
✅ Build now completes successfully  
⚠️ Runtime will fail without valid Supabase credentials  
⚠️ Database operations will not work with placeholder values
