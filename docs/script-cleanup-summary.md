# üßπ Script Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Cleaned up obsolete production test files and scripts that were no longer relevant to the current project architecture.

## ‚ùå Deleted Obsolete Scripts

### 1. `scripts/migrate-to-postgres.js`
**Why deleted:**
- Was designed for migrating from Vercel KV to Postgres
- We're already using Supabase as our database
- Referenced old database services that don't exist
- Had unused imports and outdated logic

### 2. `scripts/deployment-check.js`
**Why deleted:**
- Checked for old environment variables (KV_URL, etc.)
- Referenced deprecated API structures
- Tested file structures that have changed significantly
- Had unused imports (`https` module)
- Logic was based on older project architecture

### 3. `scripts/production-test.js`
**Why deleted:**
- Tested endpoints that may not exist or have changed
- Used old API structures and response formats
- Had unused variables and imports
- Testing logic was outdated for current implementation

### 4. `scripts/run-qa-tests.js`
**Why deleted:**
- Had multiple unused functions (`runSecurityTests`, `runAccessibilityTests`)
- Referenced test files that exist but logic was outdated
- Had unused variables throughout the code
- Could be replaced with direct npm script calls

## ‚úÖ Updated Files

### 1. `package.json`
**Removed scripts:**
- `test:qa` - pointed to deleted run-qa-tests.js
- `deploy:check` - pointed to deleted deployment-check.js  
- `deploy:test` - pointed to deleted production-test.js
- `db:migrate` - pointed to deleted migrate-to-postgres.js
- `db:setup` - pointed to deleted migrate-to-postgres.js
- `kv:migrate` - pointed to deleted migrate-to-postgres.js

**Kept scripts:**
- `deploy:verify` - still useful for basic deployment verification
- `deploy:verify:full` - updated to use E2E tests instead
- All test scripts (`test:e2e`, `test:run`, etc.)
- Build and deployment scripts

### 2. `scripts/verify-deployment.sh`
**Updated functions:**
- Replaced `run_pre_deployment_checks()` with `run_e2e_tests()`
- Replaced `run_production_tests()` with E2E test execution
- Updated `--full` flag to run E2E tests instead of deleted scripts

### 3. `docs/feedback-system-plan.md`
**Updated references:**
- Changed "Use existing `migrate-to-postgres.js` pattern" to "Use Supabase migration system"

## üéØ Benefits of Cleanup

### Code Quality
- Removed unused imports and variables
- Eliminated dead code and obsolete logic
- Reduced codebase size and complexity

### Maintenance
- No more confusion about which scripts to use
- Clearer separation between current and legacy functionality
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### Performance
- Faster build times (fewer files to process)
- Reduced bundle size
- Less cognitive overhead

### Accuracy
- Scripts now reflect current architecture
- No more false positives from outdated tests
- Deployment verification uses actual current endpoints

## üìã Remaining Scripts

### `scripts/verify-deployment.sh`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Updated and kept
- **Purpose**: Basic deployment verification
- **Usage**: `npm run deploy:verify` or `npm run deploy:verify:full`
- **Tests**: Accessibility, health endpoints, chat API, LINE integration, security headers, SSL, performance

## üöÄ Current Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- `npm run test` - Vitest unit tests
- `npm run test:run` - Run tests once
- `npm run test:coverage` - With coverage report

### E2E Tests  
- `npm run test:e2e` - Playwright E2E tests
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` - With UI
- `npm run test:e2e:headed` - With browser visible
- `npm run perf:test` - Performance tests
- `npm run a11y:test` - Accessibility tests

### Deployment
- `npm run deploy:verify` - Basic deployment check
- `npm run deploy:verify:full` - Full verification with E2E tests
- `npm run deploy:vercel` - Deploy to Vercel production

## ‚úÖ Build Status
- ‚úÖ Build completes successfully
- ‚úÖ No broken script references
- ‚úÖ All remaining scripts functional
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation clean
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor profile route issue (already fixed)
